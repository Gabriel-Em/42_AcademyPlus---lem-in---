# 42 Academy+Plus - lem-in

A 42 (school) project that required us to code an ant farm manager.

For more details regarding the project see 'lem-in - Subject(EN).pdf'

## How to use

Using a terminal from within the /lem-in directory:
- run `make` to generate the **lem-in** binary
- feed a map to the binary using `./lem-in < map`

The program will receive the data describing the ant farm in the following format:

```
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links
```

The ant farm is defined by the following links:

```
##start
1 23 3
2 16 7
#comment
3 16 3
4 16 5
5 9 3
6 1 5
7 4 8
##end
0 9 5
0-4
0-6
1-3
4-3
5-2
3-5
#another comment
4-2
2-1
7-6
7-2
7-4
6-5
```
Which coresponds to the following representation:

```
          _______________
         /               \
  ______[5]----[3]----[1] |
 /              |    /    |
[6]-----[0]----[4]  /     |
 \   __________/|  /      |
  \ /          [2]/______/
  [7]___________/
```

The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.
  - Obviously, there are some basic constraints. To be the first to arrive, ants will need to take the shortest path (and that isnâ€™t necessarily the simplest). They will also need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.
  - At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. Each room can only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain as many ants as necessary.)
  - We consider that all the ants are in the room ##start at the beginning of the game.
  - At each turn you will only display the ants that moved.
  - At each turn you can move each ant only once and through a tube (the room at
the receiving end must be empty).

### Terminal output for above map:

- number_of_ants is 23
- L1-2 means ant with id 1 moves to room 2
